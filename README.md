# Working on GitHub

Follow these steps to contribute to a project on GitHub:

## Pre-step: Set up git config if you haven't yet

Before you start working on a project, make sure to set up your git config with your name and email address. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

`git config --global user.name "Your Name"`

`git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`

## 1. Fork the repository

Click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page to create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

## 2. Clone the fork repository

Use the `git clone <Your fork link when you you click on the code button>` command to clone the forked repository to your local machine.

## 3. Create a new branch

Use the `git checkout -b "Your branch name"` command to create a new branch for your changes.

## 4. Make changes

Make changes to the code or documentation in your local repository.

## 5. Commit and push changes

Use the `git add .` then `git commit -m "message"` and `git push origin main` commands to commit and push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

## 6. Open a pull request

On the GitHub website, navigate to your forked repository and click on the "New pull request" button. Select the base repository and branch that you want to merge your changes into, and create a pull request.

## 7. Keep your local repository up to date

To keep your local repository up to date with the latest changes from the original repository, going to your fork repository and press `sync fork` and then use the `git pull origin main` command to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository into your local repository.

---

**Warning:** Remember to `sync fork` and then use `git pull origin main` often to keep your local repository up to date with the latest changes from the original repository. This will help you avoid merge conflicts and ensure that you're always working with the most recent version of the code.
