                        Steel Wool Studios, AKA Steel Wool Games is an
                        independent studio of 20-ish superstars based in
                        Oakland, CA. We create games. Sounds simple but it is a
                        little more complex. We create games for entertainment
                        as well as create games for enterprise projects. What
                        does that mean? We use our game-making skills to both
                        make games for fun but also to help in different areas
                        such as Virtual Training and Virtual Therapy. Games are
                        a universal language that has so many applications
                        across the world and across different mediums. It is a
                        common thread that binds us together and allows us to
                        use our passion to help make others happy.
                        <br /><br />Fortified by veterans of Pixar, Midway, HTC,
                        Intel, and Telltale Games who bring decades of
                        experience in collaboration with an insanely talented
                        crew of artists and engineers looking to help define the
                        next decade of gaming. We're so lucky to be able to work
                        together and share a vision of what we want Steel Wool
                        Studios to be.

                                On a typical day at the studio, we get right
                                down to business. We do stand-ups in our
                                “war-room” for daily check-ins with the entire
                                studio and begin to narrow down the progress of
                                different projects in order to keep everyone
                                working as closely as possible with one another
                                and to ensure that things are going as planned!
                                In our meetings there is plenty of opportunity
                                for ideas to flow. While keeping things
                                organized is one of our priorities, we believe
                                that every person here is responsible for their
                                own creativity, direction, and collaboration!<br /><br />
                                At noon, we all venture out to grab a bite;
                                whether it's the local food trucks, a walk to
                                Jack-London Square, or a carpool out to Alameda
                                Landing, there's always endless possibilities of
                                delicious foods around us. In our down time, a
                                couple of us love to head over next door to our
                                neighbor, Old Kan Beer & Co. Brewery for an
                                awesome meal (and beer, of course!). In the Bay
                                Area we are always finding something new to
                                eat!<br /><br />
                                Some of us stay behind and play a variety of
                                co-operative or competitive games. Once or twice
                                a week, we hold D&D sessions or movie
                                screenings. After work, there are tons of fun
                                activities to participate in. The studio is more
                                than just a work environment, it's also a place
                                to be social and have a little fun!<br /><br />
