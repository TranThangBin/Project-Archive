                        you have read the warnings provided by the manufacturer
                        of the Headset carefully before using the Headset to
                        reduce the risk of personal injury, discomfort or
                        property damage. You hereby represent and warrant that
                        you have read and follow all setup and operating
                        instructions provided with the Headset and that the
                        Headset should be configured for each individual user by
                        using the configuration software provided by the Headset
                        manufacturer before using the content or starting the
                        Game. We recommend seeing a doctor before using a

                        susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of
                        consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or
                        light patterns. Such individuals may experience a
                        seizure while watching certain images or playing a video
                        game. If you or anyone in your family has ever had
                        symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of
                        consciousness) when exposed to flashing lights, please
                        consult a medical professional and take all necessary
                        precautions prior to playing the Game.<br />
                        If you experience any of the following symptoms while

                        twitches, loss of consciousness, disorientation,
                        convulsions, involuntary movements, discontinue use of
                        that video game immediately and consult a medical
                        professional.

                        specified in clause 10.3, but we are not responsible for
                        any unforeseeable loss or damage. Loss or damage is
                        foreseeable under this EULA if it is an obvious
                        consequence of our breach or if it was contemplated by
                        you and us at the time we granted this EULA. Except as
                        otherwise specified in this clause 10, in no event shall

                        arising out of the Use of the Game or Online Features,

                        circumstances be limited to the amount actually paid by

                        loss set out in clause 10.4. Because some Jurisdictions
                        do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability
                        for certain damages, the above limitations may not apply
                        to you. <br />

                        updates to you pursuant to this EULA or otherwise shall
                        arise.<br />

                        in this EULA, you agree that SWS shall be irreparably
                        harmed, and, without any additional findings of
                        irreparable injury or harm or other considerations of
                        public policy, SWS shall be entitled to receive an
                        injunction compelling specific performance by you of
                        your obligations under this EULA without the necessity
                        of posting any bond or other security.

                        this EULA to another entity, but this will not affect
                        your rights or obligations under this EULA. You may only
                        transfer your rights or obligations under this EULA to

                        12.2 Each of the provisions of this EULA operates
                        separately. If any court or competent authority decides
                        that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the
                        remainder of the EULA will remain in full force and
                        effect.<br />

                        obligations under this EULA, or if we do not enforce our
                        rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that
                        will not mean that we have waived our rights against you
                        and will not mean that you do not have to comply with
